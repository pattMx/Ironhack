### Day 1

- In this learning unit, we have learned how branches are organized in big developer teams. We have seen how we can create a new Git repository in our local machine, how we can add and commit the changes we do in this repository and what the difference is between Git and GitHub.

- In this unit, we learned that HTML is a language for creating web pages and applications. Its elements are the building blocks of web pages. Also, we learned that the DOM is a file that contains the elements of an HTML document, their format and the browser state at a specific moment.

### Day 2

- I now have a bvasic understandig of anatomy of css, and how the syntax works

- I learned how to create me own css rules and target the elements that i want to style

- I learned how to use the universal selector \* to define styles that will be applied to all the elements on the page

- Adding CSS to your web page is part of the very basics. We create our CSS in another file, but it’s nice to know the other ways of adding styles because we will see it occasionally in the documentation and other people’s code

### Day 3

- In this lesson, you have learned how to set color property values in a few different ways: name, hexadecimal, rgb, and alpha channel transparency with rgba. You also learned that this could be applied to the font and the background.

- Changing colors is one of the original features of HTML and CSS, and remains one of the most common features today. Luckily, it is one of the more simple things you’ll be doing in CSS!

- We learned how to manipulate fonts in CSS. Having good-looking text is a crucial part of having a beautiful website. We learned how to use the basic text and font properties: font-family, font-style, font-weight, text-align, text-transform and so on.

- We learned about the box model and its properties

- We learned about CSS Units and some of their most common uses]

- We learned how we can position block elements all over the page. We have learned how to use the top, right, bottom, and left specifications in conjunction with properties such as margin, padding, and border to help you position and space elements.

### Day 4

- Responsive Web Design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size. Mobile-first helps you to design the page from bottom to top, avoiding the use of useless information on the mobile versions.

- With media queries, you can change the design of the website depending on the viewport size, and you can check out the different viewport versions with the Chrome Dev Tools. Finally, you will be able to control the font size and the line height on a Responsive website

### Day 5

- Flexbox is a super powerful tool for designing the layouts of our web pages. You’re now able to align and distribute space among flex items in a flex container.]

- Using flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices

# Semana 2

### Day 1

- We also learned how to declare a variable and got familiar with let, const and var and learn how to differentiate them on a basic level.]

- We learned that JavaScript is a dynamically typed language and that it’s possible to change values and types of variables in the runtime (as you code).

### Day 2

- In this lesson, we learned how to declare, use, and manipulate numbers and strings - two primitive data types. Also, we got familiar with some of the inherited number and string methods as well as with some of the new ones

- We have learned that besides string and number, there are other primitive data types that you will be using heavily: boolean, null and undefined. Variables that have boolean values can only have the value of true or false. Booleans are very often used with logical operators: and (&&), or (||), not (!). Besides being true or false, variables also can have truthy and falsy values.
