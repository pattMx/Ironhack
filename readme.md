I now have a bvasic understandig of anatomy of css, and how the syntax works

I learned how to create me own css rules and target the elements that i want to style

I learned how to use the universal selector \* to define styles that will be applied to all the elements on the page

Adding CSS to your web page is part of the very basics. We create our CSS in another file, but it’s nice to know the other ways of adding styles because we will see it occasionally in the documentation and other people’s code
